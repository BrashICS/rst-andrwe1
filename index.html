    In the game tetris, the player must place 7 different types of blocks onto a grid. when a full 'line' (A line is a row full of pieces), is completed, it is removed from the grid, and points are given.<br><br> The game ends when the grid becomes full and no more pieces can be spawned.

    each piece that drops is 10 points, 1 line is 100, 2 lines is 300, 3 lines is 500, and 4 lines 800 points. <br><br>
    If the grid doesn't fit on your screen, press ctrl and + or - until the full grid fits on your screen. <br><br>

    Use 'W' to rotate the piece, 'A' to move to the left, 'S' to move down faster, and 'D' to move to the right <br><br>
    After your game is over, press play to start a new game. <br><br>
    Kill game will stop the game completely, and you wont be able to resume.
