<h1>My letter to the Fans</H1> <br><br>
Dear Mr. Brash (Or whoever finds this work after I become Famous!), <br><br>

After finsihing this project, it looks nothing like my storyboard, or the 4 lines of psudocode I had (oops), but I decided to not make more psudocode because then its like post instead of pre and the psudocode is the preworkout of the gym session, not the hot tub afterward. Becuase then it would would be hottub code instead of pasghetti code. <br><br>

Aside from the psudocode fiasco, I think I took a very different approach to this project than I thought I would. I focused only on the back end development, (who knew that listening to a wise man would be the wise thing to do!), much different from my approach last year and my game looking more extraterestrial than ET. <br><br>

Even though using AI to assist with the styling and front end was an option, I decided to opt out of that. My main reason for that being currently the game feels like my game, and something that I am actually proud of. With the assist of AI, it wouldn't feel like my game anymore, therefore losing my sense of proudness (is that a word?) and meaning the game has. <br><br>

In general I felt like using AI would have just been wrong, especially considering I'm going into the field of Computer Science, it feels wrong to use AI to do something I will eventually (hopefully!) be getting paid to do. In my head it just doesn't feel right so thats why the front end looks kinda doo doo. <br><br>

Im actually so braindead right now so if you're reading this and are like 'Andrew did you like get run over by a car before writing this?', Im actually fine I just don't know whats going on either. <br><br>

Thanks for listening to my TedTalk, <br><br>

Oh also, Some of the other functions like next piece and T spin are just not there. I overestimated myself. Oops. You can guess what the next peice will be though, you'll be right 15% of the time! <br><br>
